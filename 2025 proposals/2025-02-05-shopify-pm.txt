üö© **Potential Red Flags to Consider:**

### **Broad Role Scope:**
- **Risk:** The description is comprehensive but lacks specific deliverables or success metrics.  
  **Clarifying Question:** _"Could you clarify the specific KPIs or success metrics you‚Äôll be using to evaluate project performance?"_

### **Potential for Role Overload:**
- **Risk:** Managing multiple projects, teams, and workflows may lead to overwhelming workloads.  
  **Clarifying Question:** _"How many projects will I be expected to manage simultaneously, and what is the typical team size per project?"_

### **Ambiguity in Decision-Making Authority:**
- **Risk:** It‚Äôs unclear how much autonomy the Project Manager will have in decision-making.  
  **Clarifying Question:** _"Will I have the authority to make decisions on resource allocation and workflow changes, or will these require approval from higher management?"_

### **Limited Information on Team Structure:**
- **Risk:** No details about the composition of the development team (e.g., junior vs. senior devs, in-house vs. freelancers).  
  **Clarifying Question:** _"Could you provide more details on the development team structure and reporting lines?"_

### **Workload Fluctuations:**
- **Risk:** While it's labeled as long-term, there might be inconsistent project loads depending on client demand.  
  **Clarifying Question:** _"Can you outline the expected weekly workload and if there are peak periods with higher project volumes?"_
