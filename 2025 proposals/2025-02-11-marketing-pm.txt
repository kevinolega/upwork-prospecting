## 🚩 **Potential Red Flags to Consider:**
### 1️⃣ No Previous Freelancer Reviews (New or Unrated Client)  
**No history of freelancer feedback, making it hard to assess reliability.**  
**Protection:**  
> "Have you worked with freelance project coordinators before? If so, what challenges have you faced?"  

### 2️⃣ Low Overall Spend ($5.2K Across 19 Jobs)
**Suggests short-term contracts or minimal budgets per hire.**  
**Protection:**  
> "Is there potential for an extension beyond 3 months if the project goes well?"  

### 3️⃣ Unclear Long-Term Commitment
**One-time project description suggests they may not be seeking a long-term hire.**  
**Protection:**  
> "Would you be open to extending this role based on project needs?"  

---

> "Would you be open to extending this role beyond 3 months if it proves successful?"  

📌 **Clarify Long-Term Workload:**  
> "What does a typical week look like in terms of task volume and team coordination?"  

📌 **Ask About Client’s Freelancer Experience:**  
> "Have you worked with freelance project coordinators before? If so, what challenges have you faced?"  

📌 **Understand Onboarding Process:**  
> "What does the onboarding process look like for new hires in this role?"  

---

## 🔎 **Final Recommendation:**
