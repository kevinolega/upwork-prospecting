### **üö© Red Flags in the Job Posting:**

1.  **Low Hourly Rate ($12 - $14/hour):**
    
    *   **Risk:** The pay rate is low for a **senior-level role** requiring leadership experience, strategic decision-making, and technical expertise. Comparable positions often start at **$20-$30/hour** or higher.
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Given the role‚Äôs seniority, leadership expectations, and required skills, would you consider adjusting the rate to reflect the complexity of responsibilities?"_
        
2.  **High-Performance Expectations:**
    
    *   **Risk:** The combination of **managing a team, overseeing workflows, implementing technology, and providing executive-level reporting** might lead to **workload overload.**
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Could you clarify how the workload will be distributed and what the top priorities will be during the first six months?"_
        
3.  **Preference for Real Estate Experience:**
    
    *   **Risk:** While not mandatory, the preference for **real estate expertise** may create challenges for candidates outside the field.
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Could you confirm if a background in real estate is essential, or would transferable skills in similar industries suffice?"_
        
4.  **Potential for Scope Creep:**
    
    *   **Risk:** Responsibilities such as **verifying Upwork profiles and managing external relationships** might expand beyond core project management duties, leading to **scope creep.**
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Will responsibilities outside core project coordination, such as verifying Upwork profiles, be time-limited or ongoing?"_
        
5.  **Timezone Requirement (7 AM to 6 PM PST):**
    
    *   **Risk:** The **broad availability window** may require flexibility, creating potential conflicts for candidates with other commitments.
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Will the role require full availability during 7 AM to 6 PM PST, or can tasks be managed asynchronously outside scheduled meetings?"_
        

### **üõ°Ô∏è Expanded Protective Measures:**

1.  **Negotiate for Competitive Pay:**
    
    *   _"This role involves strategic leadership and long-term team scaling. Would you consider rates closer to industry standards for senior project coordinators (e.g., $18-$20/hour)?"_
        
    *   Justify higher pay by emphasizing your leadership skills and technical expertise.
        
2.  **Clarify Priority Areas:**
    
    *   _"Could you confirm the immediate priorities for this role (e.g., team management, technology implementation, reporting) to ensure alignment with your goals?"_
        
    *   This ensures a focused approach without taking on too many responsibilities at once.
        
3.  **Request Details on Reporting and Metrics:**
    
    *   _"How frequently will updates and reports to C-level executives be expected, and what format do you prefer (e.g., dashboards, written reports)?"_
        
    *   This helps streamline reporting expectations and avoids unnecessary work.
        
4.  **Define Scalability Expectations:**
    
    *   _"For team growth over the next five years, will the new hires be supported with additional resources or training to ensure scalability?"_
        
    *   Ensures you aren‚Äôt left managing team growth without proper support.
        
5.  **Clarify Communication and Collaboration Tools:**
    
    *   _"Which tools will be used for managing team workflows and collaboration (e.g., Asana, Google Workspace)?"_
        
    *   Familiarity with their tech stack will streamline onboarding and reduce inefficiencies.
        

### **Final Thoughts:**

*   **Opportunity:** This is an excellent opportunity to contribute to **scalable, community-focused housing solutions** with a reputable organization. The benefits package and growth potential are standout features.
    
*   **Caution:** The **low pay range for senior-level responsibilities** and **broad scope of tasks** need clarification to ensure alignment with your expectations and expertise.
