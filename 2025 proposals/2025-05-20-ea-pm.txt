Here’s a **full analysis of this job post** — not to sell you on it, but to **protect you from bad clients**. I’ve separated the review into three sections:

---

## ✅ **Merits**

1. **Project Management Focus:**
   They're clear that this isn't just a glorified admin role — they *want structure, task management, and follow-through*. This could suit someone with PM skills and experience leading small teams or CEOs.

2. **Tools Mentioned Upfront:**
   Google Workspace, ClickUp, Trello, Airtable, Slack — all familiar and common tools. No red flags with weird or proprietary tech.

3. **Contract-to-Hire Mentioned:**
   Indicates some potential for long-term work, especially if you perform well.

4. **Duration of More Than 6 Months:**
   Suggests stability, which is better than the typical short-term assistant churn.

5. **Role Clarity in “What You’ll Do” Section:**
   They listed tasks clearly and comprehensively — task tracking, process documentation, light admin — with no immediate bait-and-switch language.

---

## ⚠️ **Neutral-to-Caution Points**

These are **not red flags yet**, but they could lead to problems depending on the actual client behavior.

1. **“Shifting Priorities” and “Fast-Paced”**
   These phrases often mean disorganized leadership or constant fire-fighting. If there's no clear direction or you’re the one expected to stabilize chaos alone, that’s a risk. Especially with:

   > “Bring structure and accountability to a growing business.”

   This reads like they expect *you* to fix their lack of structure and discipline.

2. **Executive Assistant + Project Manager = Scope Blur**
   These are two different jobs. One is task grunt work, the other is leadership, communication, and strategy. If they don’t clearly define where *executive assistant ends and project manager begins*, this could become a **scope creep trap** — doing high-responsibility work at admin-level pay.

3. **Bid Range and Hourly Pay Misalignment**

   * They listed **\$18–30/hr** for the job.
   * But the **average hourly paid historically is \$6.34/hr**.
   * The **lowest current bid is \$10**.

   That means you're bidding in a pool where their past behavior shows they often **underpay**, but they’re posting this job under “Expert” and “Complex.”

4. **Connect Cost is High (16)**
   For a job with **one client review**, **50% hire rate**, and **\$1.3k total spend**, this is a **steep Connect investment** with **weak client history**.

---

## 🚩 **Red Flags and Risks**

1. **Extremely Low Historical Pay**

   * \$6.34/hr avg.
   * 202 hours paid.
   * \$1.3k total spend across 12 hires → that's **\~\$108/client**, suggesting **many tiny jobs or abandoned hires**.

   Even if the job post *says* \$18–30/hr, the client’s payment history shows a pattern of hiring cheap.

2. **1 Review Only**

   * 4.4 stars from just 1 freelancer.
   * Not enough data to assess whether they’re respectful, responsive, or problematic.
   * With 14 jobs posted and 12 hires, the lack of reviews is suspicious. Either they hire people and end quickly, or they don’t close contracts properly.

3. **“Act as a Project Manager for the CEO”**
   This often translates to:

   * CEO offloads all chaos to you
   * You’re expected to guess their priorities
   * Blame falls on you when things slip

   Without **clear authority**, **access to stakeholders**, and **decision-making power**, this role could become **high accountability with no control**.

4. **Potential Emotional Labor Role**
   The combination of “check in regularly,” “bring accountability,” “fast-paced,” and “CEO support” sometimes masks **emotional labor** — being a therapist, cheerleader, and planner for a reactive founder.

---

## 🔍 Final Verdict

* **✅ Worth applying only if:**
  You have a strong discovery call and **push back on scope early**. This might work if they genuinely want a *part-time operator to help them level up*.

* **⚠️ Proceed with caution if:**
  They seem disorganized or vague in interviews. Ask: *What happened to your last assistants? What do you define as success?*

* **🚩 Avoid if:**
  They try to pay closer to \$18/hr while offloading high-responsibility PM tasks, or they dodge scope/prioritization questions.

I’d like to audition as your Executive Assistant with a Project Management focus.

I understand that you're looking for someone who can take ownership of task management, follow-through, and documentation—bringing structure to a growing business while staying flexible as priorities shift.

Reviewing your job description, I’ve performed all these tasks with my past clients.

Since 2016, I’ve worked as a project manager with international teams in operations, web development, and digital marketing. I’ve supported founders, executives, and remote teams by building systems, tracking progress, and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. I’m used to shifting priorities, async communication, and documenting workflows to increase efficiency across the board.

I’m proficient in ClickUp, Trello, Asana, Google Sheets, Google Workspace, Airtable, and Slack. I’m comfortable coordinating tasks, building action plans, documenting SOPs, and maintaining visibility for leadership.

My key areas of expertise include task coordination, client and team communication, time management, and administrative support.

I propose starting with 10–20 hours a week, so you can evaluate my work risk-free. You can view my experience and background at https://kevinolega.com/xp. Let me know if you'd like to schedule a conversation.
