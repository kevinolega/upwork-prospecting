### **Strengths of the Posting:**

1.  **Clearly Defined Role:** The posting outlines specific tasks and tools, leaving little ambiguity about what the role entails.
    
2.  **Long-Term Opportunity:** A commitment of **6+ months** suggests stability and the potential for consistent work if the candidate performs well.
    
3.  **Proven Client Reliability:**
    
    *   **$33K spent** and **5.0-star reviews** indicate the client is professional and likely pays on time.
        
    *   The **verified payment method** adds confidence.
        
4.  **Structured Work Environment:** With tools like Slack and HighLevel, and a clear focus on online events, the company seems to have **established workflows.**
    

### **üö© Red Flags in the Job Posting:**

1.  **Low Pay Range ($10 - $20/hour):**
    
    *   **Risk:** The pay range is on the **lower side for the responsibilities** involved (e.g., project management, funnel building, and client communication). The client‚Äôs **average payment of $10.90/hour** further suggests a tendency to hire at the lower end.
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Given the responsibilities and tools involved, could you confirm if the budget allows for higher rates for candidates with relevant experience?"_
        
2.  **Broad Scope of Responsibilities:**
    
    *   **Risk:** The role combines **project management, client communication, and technical work (funnels, copywriting, and graphic design)**. This can lead to **scope creep**, especially with a low pay range.
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Could you clarify the percentage of time expected to be spent on project management versus technical tasks like funnel building, copywriting, and graphic design?"_
        
    *   Propose separating roles if the workload becomes too broad.
        
3.  **High Expectations for Low Pay:**
    
    *   **Risk:** The job requires working with multiple teams, analyzing stats, and possibly building funnels, all while meeting weekly targets. This level of involvement suggests a **misalignment between pay and expectations.**
        
    *   **Protection:** _"For high-value tasks like funnel building and event marketing, is there flexibility in adjusting the pay to reflect the additional responsibilities?"_
        
4.  **27% Hire Rate:**
    
    *   **Risk:** The client has only hired for **6 of 19 posted jobs**, indicating they may not proceed with every listing. This could reflect **indecisiveness** or exploratory job postings.
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Could you confirm if this position is ready to be filled immediately or if you‚Äôre still exploring options?"_
        
5.  **Unpaid Screening Test:**
    
    *   **Risk:** The phrase _‚ÄúWrite ‚ÄòI am hungry‚Äô at the top of your proposal‚Äù_ suggests the client uses small tests to filter candidates. This could lead to **additional unpaid tasks** during the selection process.
        
    *   **Protection:** Politely decline unpaid tests if asked to complete any beyond the initial screening requirement.
        

### **üõ°Ô∏è Expanded Protective Measures:**

1.  **Clarify Role Scope and Prioritize Tasks:**
    
    *   _‚ÄúCould you provide a breakdown of the key priorities for this role? For example, how much of the focus will be on project management versus technical tasks like building funnels or reviewing stats?‚Äù_
        
    *   This helps define expectations and ensures that technical tasks don‚Äôt dominate your workload.
        
2.  **Set Boundaries for Client Communication:**
    
    *   _‚ÄúWill client communication be limited to scheduled updates, or will I be expected to handle ongoing inquiries?‚Äù_
        
    *   This ensures clear boundaries around communication time.
        
3.  **Negotiate Pay Based on Value:**
    
    *   If you have strong experience, propose a rate closer to **$18-$20/hour** while emphasizing your expertise: _‚ÄúGiven my background in project management and online marketing, I‚Äôd like to propose a rate of $18/hour, which aligns with the scope of work and required tools.‚Äù_
        
4.  **Secure Time Tracking for Technical Tasks:**
    
    *   For time-intensive activities like **funnel building or stat reviews**, ask: _‚ÄúWill these tasks be separately logged and billed, or are they included under general project management hours?‚Äù_
        
5.  **Request Milestone-Based Evaluation:**
    
    *   Suggest a **trial period** with milestones to evaluate workload alignment: _‚ÄúWould it be helpful to start with a 4-week trial to align expectations and adjust workflows if needed?‚Äù_
        
    *   This ensures the role is sustainable without risking long-term burnout.
        
6.  **Propose Task Automation Where Possible:**
    
    *   If processes like stat reviews or email templates seem repetitive, recommend automation to save time. For example: _‚ÄúWould you consider automating basic reporting to focus more on strategic improvements?‚Äù_
        

### **Final Thoughts:**

*   **Opportunity:** This role provides an excellent entry point for gaining experience in **online event marketing** and **project coordination**. The **long-term nature** and clear deliverables offer stability.
    
*   **Caution:** The **low pay, broad scope of responsibilities, and high client expectations** require careful negotiation to ensure you‚Äôre fairly compensated and not overworked. Address these early to avoid undervaluing your expertise.
    

Would you like help crafting a proposal that balances enthusiasm with protective boundaries?

I recently served as a project manager at a California-based digital marketing agency and web development company, I spearheaded full-cycle project management from planning, to execution, to QA. I became the single point of contact for communication, task delegation, and quality assurance. My experience spans a wide range of projects, including building websites for luxury car dealers, upscale recovery facilities, exclusive membership clubs, and equine marketplace websites, as well as developing backend web apps for inventory management, sales event planning, and expanding referral networks. Additionally, we crafted mobile apps tailored for luxury services including a fleet management system. This work deepened my understanding of the online business landscape, from website and app development to influencer marketing and brand building. I utilized tools like ClickUp, Asana, Miro, Slack, and ChatGPT to streamline tasks and workflows. We generally followed a combination of Agile and Waterfall project management methodology along with regular scrum meetings. I started from an assistant role to handling the projects by myself.
