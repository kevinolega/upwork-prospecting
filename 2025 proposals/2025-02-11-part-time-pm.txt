🚩 **Potential Red Flags to Consider:**

1️⃣ **Earnings Structure – Profit-Based Bonus May Fluctuate**  
   - **Base salary of $750/month** is low for a management role.
   - The extra **5% of net profit** is not guaranteed and could fluctuate based on business performance.  
   - **Protection:** _"Can you provide historical profit data to estimate expected earnings more accurately?"_

2️⃣ **Client's Average Pay Rate is Low ($10.05/hr)**  
   - While this role **pays much higher** ($1,250–$1,500/month), their history suggests a preference for **lower-cost freelancers**.  
   - **Protection:** Confirm whether previous management roles were paid fairly.

3️⃣ **High Number of Invites (62) but Many Unanswered (27)**  
   - Suggests a **wide casting net approach**, which can lead to long selection times or unclear hiring criteria.  
   - **Protection:** _"When do you expect to finalize hiring, and what is the onboarding process?"_

4️⃣ **Scope Creep Risk – Responsibilities Span Operations, Growth, and Team Management**  
   - Managing ads, team, project coordination, and profitability is **a big workload for a part-time role**.  
   - **Protection:** _"Can you clarify the primary focus of the role—operations, growth, or team management?"_

---

✅ **Positive Indicators:**
- **Long-Term Stability Potential** – Contract-to-hire structure suggests ongoing work if successful.
- **Performance-Based Bonus** – Opportunity to earn more if business performs well.
- **Fast Hiring Process** – 12 interviews already in progress, showing active client engagement.
- **Established E-commerce Business** – Large freelancer network and specialization in automation suggest a structured operation.

---

🛡️ **Protective Measures to Include in Proposal:**
- 📌 **Clarify Compensation Expectations:** _"What is the average net profit for the past 6 months to estimate earnings accurately?"_
- 📌 **Ask About Hiring Timeline:** _"I see you have 12 interviews in progress. What is the expected timeframe for making a decision?"_
- 📌 **Clarify Primary Role Focus:** _"Would the primary focus be on operations, profitability, or team management?"_
- 📌 **Confirm Workload Expectations:** _"Given the role’s scope, is there flexibility to adjust the workload if certain areas require more attention?"_
- 📌 **Ensure a Trial Period is Defined:** _"Would there be a trial period to assess fit before transitioning to a long-term contract?"_

---

🔎 **Final Recommendation:**
- **Opportunity Level:** **Medium-High** – This could be a solid role if the profit-based bonus is predictable, but clarity on expectations and workload is crucial.
- **Approach:** Proceed with strategic questions. Ensure that earnings are sustainable, the workload is manageable, and hiring expectations are clear before committing.

## Screening Question Responses

### **A team member keeps missing deadlines, delaying client projects. You’ve reminded them multiple times, but the issue persists. How would you handle this to keep projects on track?**
I’d first check if there are any blockers preventing them from meeting deadlines—whether it’s workload issues, lack of clarity, or personal challenges. If the problem persists, I’d set a structured accountability system, such as tracking progress in ClickUp with clear deadlines and follow-ups. If delays continue, I’d escalate the issue and consider reassigning tasks to ensure projects stay on schedule.

### **Sales are coming in, but net profit is low due to high ad spend and low repeat purchases. What steps would you take to improve profitability?**
I’d analyze ad performance and optimize for higher ROI—reducing wasted ad spend, testing new audiences, and refining targeting. Simultaneously, I’d implement retention strategies such as improving email marketing, launching loyalty programs, and increasing AOV through upsells and bundles.

### **A client is upset about a store delivery delay due to internal miscommunication and threatens to leave a bad review. How would you resolve this while protecting our reputation?**
I’d acknowledge their frustration, apologize for the miscommunication, and provide a clear resolution—whether it’s an expedited shipping option, a discount, or a freebie as a goodwill gesture. I’d follow up proactively to ensure they are satisfied and encourage them to update their review based on their overall experience. Additionally, I’d refine internal processes to prevent future delays.
