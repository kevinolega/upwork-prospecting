üö© **Potential Red Flags to Consider:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Client's Average Pay Rate is Significantly Lower than the Posted Range**  
   - **$11.40/hr avg paid**, but they list **$15‚Äì$35/hr** for this role.  
   - This could mean they offer lower pay once negotiations begin.  
   - **Protection:** _"Can you confirm the actual hourly rate range based on previous hires for this type of role?"_

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Very High Number of Interviews (28) & Invites (34) with No Clear Hires Yet**  
   - Indicates slow decision-making or unclear hiring criteria.  
   - **Protection:** _"What is the timeline for selecting a candidate? Are you looking for one hire or multiple?"_

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Mid-Tier Rating (4.4/5) ‚Äì Some Freelancer Issues in the Past**  
   - This isn't necessarily bad, but lower than top-rated clients.  
   - **Protection:** _Check reviews for red flags (e.g., scope creep, low payments, miscommunication)._

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Short-Term Posting but Could Require Long-Term Commitment**  
   - Only listed as **1-3 months**, but **$1.2M spend** suggests long-term projects.  
   - **Protection:** _"Is there potential for ongoing work beyond the initial contract?"_

---

‚úÖ **Positive Indicators:**
- ‚úîÔ∏è **High Spending Client** ‚Äì **$1.2M total spend** means they have money to pay (if they offer fair rates).
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Active Hiring History** ‚Äì **86% hire rate** means they do fill roles they post.
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Clearly Defined Role** ‚Äì The responsibilities and tasks are well structured.
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Opportunity for Long-Term Work** ‚Äì If the pay and expectations align, this could lead to stable ongoing work.

---

üõ°Ô∏è **Protective Measures to Include in Proposal:**
- üìå **Clarify Pay Expectations:** _"Your previous hires averaged $11.40/hr, while this role is listed at $15‚Äì$35/hr. Can you confirm where this position falls within that range?"_
- üìå **Ask About Hiring Timeline:** _"I see you have 28 interviews in progress. What is the expected timeframe for making a decision?"_
- üìå **Clarify Long-Term Potential:** _"You‚Äôve spent over $1.2M on Upwork. Is this position likely to extend beyond the 1-3 month initial period?"_
- üìå **Confirm Workload & Responsibilities:** _"Would this role involve hands-on team management, or is it more focused on project oversight and scheduling?"_

---

üîé **Final Recommendation:**
- **Opportunity Level:** Medium-High ‚Äì Strong spending history, but concerns about actual pay rate, hiring speed, and past freelancer issues.
- **Approach:** Proceed with caution. If the pay is fair and scope is clear, this could be a solid opportunity. But avoid a long, unpaid interview process or bait-and-switch pay tactics.

## Proposal

I‚Äôd like to audition as your Project Manager for your development team. I understand you need someone to manage project pipelines, optimize ticketing systems, and ensure project deadlines are met. I‚Äôve successfully handled similar roles, keeping teams organized, tracking progress, and ensuring smooth execution.

Since 2016, I‚Äôve managed web and software development projects, with expertise in:
- Project Coordination: Overseeing multiple development projects, managing priorities, and optimizing workflows.
- Agile & Scrum Methodologies: Using ClickUp, Jira, Asana, and Trello to track sprints, milestones, and backlog management.
- Process Improvement: Developing efficient ticketing systems, reducing bottlenecks, and improving turnaround times.
- Team & Stakeholder Communication: Ensuring clear status updates, risk mitigation, and proactive problem-solving to keep projects on track.

I propose starting with 10-20 hours per week to establish a strong workflow. Once the team is optimized, we can adjust as needed.

You can review my detailed work experience at [https://kevinolega.com/xp](https://kevinolega.com/xp).

The best way to evaluate me is through a conversation. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to discuss further. Looking forward to hearing from you.

**Best regards,**  
**Kevin**
