üö© **Potential Red Flags to Consider:**

### **High Competition (50+ Proposals):**
- **Risk:** Many applicants may dilute visibility.  
  **Protection:** _"To ensure alignment, could you share what qualities or experiences you're specifically looking for in the ideal candidate?"_  
  Tailor your proposal to highlight both project management and QA expertise to stand out.

### **Broad Role Scope:**
- **Risk:** The role involves both project management and QA, which may lead to role overload.  
  **Protection:** _"Will this role primarily focus on project management or QA, or is it an even split between both responsibilities?"_

### **Unclear Decision-Making Authority:**
- **Risk:** It‚Äôs unclear how much autonomy you‚Äôll have in managing projects or QA processes.  
  **Protection:** _"What level of decision-making authority will I have regarding task prioritization, issue escalation, and QA process improvements?"_

### **Potential for Inconsistent Workload:**
- **Risk:** While labeled as long-term, web development projects often experience fluctuations based on client demand.  
  **Protection:** _"Can you provide insights into the typical workload for this role? Are there peak seasons or periods of lower activity?"_

### **Lack of Detail on Team Dynamics:**
- **Risk:** No mention of team size, structure, or reporting lines, which could lead to unclear collaboration dynamics.  
  **Protection:** _"Could you clarify the size of the development team and how the project management and QA roles will integrate with existing workflows?"_

P.S.

Will the primary focus of this role be project management, QA, or an equal combination of both?

Could you provide more details about the development team‚Äôs structure and how the project manager will collaborate with developers?

Besides JIRA, are there specific tools or processes currently in place for project management and QA, or would part of the role involve optimizing these systems?

What is the typical team size per project?
