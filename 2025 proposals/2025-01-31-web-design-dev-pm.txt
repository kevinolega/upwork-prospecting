### **üö© Red Flags in the Job Posting:**

1.  **Low Pay Range Compared to Market & Client's Previous Spending ($15-$30/hour):**
    
    *   **Risk:** The **client has paid an average of $40.98/hour** but is now offering **$15-$30/hour**, which is **below industry standards** for a **Web Development PM.**
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Given the client-facing responsibilities and technical knowledge required, would you consider adjusting the rate closer to your historical average ($40/hour)?"_
        
2.  **Managing 7-12 Projects Simultaneously:**
    
    *   **Risk:** Handling **7-12 web development projects at once** is a **heavy workload**, potentially leading to **burnout or under-compensation.**
        
    *   **Protection:** _"What support systems (e.g., additional project managers, assistants) are in place to ensure manageable workloads?"_
        
3.  **Client-Facing Role Increases Stress & Responsibility:**
    
    *   **Risk:** Direct client communication means **handling expectations, scope changes, and potential escalations.**
        
    *   **Protection:** _"What process is in place for managing difficult clients and scope disputes? Will I have decision-making authority?"_
        
4.  **Strict EST Hours May Limit Flexibility (9 AM - 5 PM EST):**
    
    *   **Risk:** If you are not in **North America or willing to adjust your schedule,** this could be a challenge.
        
    *   **Protection:** _"Are there set meeting times, or is there some flexibility in work hours?"_
        

### **üõ°Ô∏è Expanded Protective Measures:**

1.  **Negotiate a Fair Rate Based on Complexity:**
    
    *   _"Considering the scope of managing up to 12 projects simultaneously, client interactions, and technical understanding required, would you consider aligning the rate with the complexity of the role ($40+/hour)?"_
        
2.  **Clarify the Number of Active Projects at a Given Time:**
    
    *   _"Will all 7-12 projects be active simultaneously, or will they be staggered?"_
        
    *   Ensures **realistic workload expectations.**
        
3.  **Confirm QA and Approval Processes:**
    
    *   _"Are there existing quality assurance (QA) checklists and client approval workflows, or will I need to implement them?"_
        
    *   Prevents **last-minute client complaints or revisions.**
        
4.  **Secure Decision-Making Authority for Scope Management:**
    
    *   _"Will I have authority to push back on client requests that exceed scope, or will approvals need to go through management?"_
        
    *   Prevents **scope creep** and ensures you **aren‚Äôt forced into over-promising.**
        
5.  **Determine Whether There‚Äôs a Team for Support:**
    
    *   _"Are there additional project managers, or will I be the sole PM for all projects?"_
        
    *   Helps set **realistic workload expectations.**
        

### **Final Thoughts:**

*   **Opportunity:** A **great role with a reputable client** offering **long-term stability, client-facing experience, and leadership potential.**
    
*   **Caution:** The **low pay range, heavy workload (7-12 projects), and strict EST work hours** require careful negotiation. **Clarifying project scope, compensation, and available support** will be crucial.
